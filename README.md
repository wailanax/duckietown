# RPI DUCKIETOWN

This repository is a fork of the original at http://github.com/duckietown/Software 

In this repository we will collect all the software, middleware, drivers, ROS modules, and so on, that would allow to run our cars. 

Any changes to this repo will require a pull request unless you are a member of the owners group for rpiRobotics.
